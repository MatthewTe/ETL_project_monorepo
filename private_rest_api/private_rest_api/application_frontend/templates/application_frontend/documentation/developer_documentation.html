        <p>At its core the project is stood up by a docker-compose file. There may be higher level orchestration tools that are used to manage the project in production such as Ansible or a a container orchestration system like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm but at its core all the services are started using the main docker-compose file.</p>

        <p>The core of the project is contained in the docker-compose.yml file which contains the rough outline of the services used. In production the core docker components are overwritten using the <code>-f docker-compose.prod.yml</code> file. In development a different configuration is used to build the project on a local machine via <code>-f docker-compose.dev.yml</code>. The separate docker-compose files for production and development can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/MatthewTe/ETL_project_monorepo">repository</a>. Currently the main difference between the development and production environments are the environment variables used to configure the services. The development environment builds the service using generic environment variables from the publicly available <code>dev.env</code> file. In contrast the production environment requires you to create your own <code>prod.env</code> file using the public env file as a guide.  For example if you were deploying the project for development you would use the development configuration via:</p>
        <p><code>docker-compose -f docker-compose.ym -f docker-compose.dev.yml up</code></p>
        <p>And if you wanted to deploy it in a production/staging environment you would run:</p>
        <p><code>docker-compose -f docker-compose.ym -f docker-compose.prod.yml up</code></p>        
        <p>Typically components in the mono-repo are contained in a sub-directory that contains three main objects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The source code of the component (for example the actual django codebase or nginx server configuration)</li>
            <li>A Dockerfile that describes the image</li>
            <li>A bash script file that the docker-compose file executes after the container is built.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>An example of a components <code>Dockerfile</code> is:</p>   
        <pre>
            <code>
#############################################################
# The Dockerfile for building and initalizing the REST API
#############################################################
FROM python:3.8

# Creating non-root user to run in container:
RUN groupadd -g 999 django_user \
 && useradd -r -u 999 -g django_user django_user

# Adding Permissions to the Django User:

# The enviroment variable ensures that the python output is set straight
# to the terminal with out buffering it first
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Copying the django site files into the container: 
COPY private_rest_api /private_rest_api
RUN chown -R django_user:django_user private_rest_api

WORKDIR /private_rest_api

# Installing python packages:
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

USER django_user
</code>
        </pre>

        <p>The docker-compose file starts all the necessary containers and connects them via an internal network currently called (for legacy reasons) the <code>rest_api_network</code>. The nginx proxy server (see below) is the only service externally exposed. All other connection/interaction between containers is done from within the network.</p>
        <p>Components like the databases are connected to volumes that allow for persistent storage outside of container creation/destruction (See below).</p>
        <p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/MatthewTe/ETL_project_monorepo">main git repository</a> to see how each component is structured (code-Dockerfile-.sh script)</p>

<div class="documentation_section">
    <h1 id="celery">Scheduling processes for django through Celery</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The data ingestion in the project is done via scheduled processes that extract, transform and ingest external data on a predefined schedule. More documentation on how data ingestion functions operate with the API are available, but in this context it is sufficient to say that the django web server requires that processes be executed at desired intervals. The most natural way to accomplish this is through the use of the Celery task queue.</p>    
        
        <h3>Celery Workers</h3>
        <p>The celery worker that executes the tasks is run insides its own docker container built from the django web server Dockerfile. All examples are from the development docker-compose file and overwrite/add elements to the main compose file:</p>
        
        <pre>
            <code>
  # Celery Worker:
  celery-worker:
    command: ["./run_celery_worker.sh"]
    env_file: 
      dev.env
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Like the django server the workers are launched via a <code>.sh</code> script that starts the worker daemon via the typical command <code>celery -A private_rest_api worker</code>. The worker is configured using environment variables stored in the relevant <code>.env</code> file. Currently the only configuration allowed is to set the minimum and maximum number of workers in the pool via the two env variables:</p>
        <p><code>MAX_AUTOSCALE: 10</code></p>
        <p><code>MIN_AUTOSCALE: 4</code></p>
        <p>Aside from auto-scaling, specifying external destinations for the log and pid (<code>--logifle</code> , <code>--pidfile</code>,  <code>-—statedb</code>) files generated by the worker process is the next step though at the time of writing this has not been done.</p>
    
        <h3>Celery Beat</h3>
        <p>Once a pool of workers has been set up the next step was to configure and start the actual process scheduler that tells the workers when to execute the tasks in the queue. This is done via celery beat due to its direct integration with django and task scheduling through django models. Like the worker celery beat is run inside a docker container built from the django web Dockerfile:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
  # Celery Beat Scheduler:
  celery-beat-scheduler:
    volumes: 
      - .:/app
    env_file:
      dev.env
    command: ["./run_celery_beat.sh"]
</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Also like the worker container the beat daemon is launched via an <code>.sh</code> script that is copied into the container. Currently this script only runs the generic <code>celery -A private_rest_api beat -l INFO  --schedule=django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler</code> command as all configuration of the beat scheduler is done inside the django <code>settings.py</code> file.</p>
    
        <h3>Celery Flower Monitor</h3>
        <p>The third upstream process for celery is a flower instance - a tool that monitors the celery pool and keeps track of all workers and tasks they carry out. The same container - <code>.sh</code> script arrangement is again used (the Dockerfile is built from the <code>mher/flower</code> image and the environment variables used to configure the flower instance are as follows:</p>
        <p><code>CELERY_BROKER_URL</code></p>
        <p><code>CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND</code></p>
        <p><code>FLOWER_OAUTH2_KEY</code></p>
        <p><code>FLOWER_OAUTH2_SECRET</code></p>
        <p><code>FLOWER_OAUTH2_REDIRECT_URI</code></p>
        <p><code>FLOWER_AUTH_SCHEME</code></p>
        <p><code>FLOWER_GIT_EMAIL</code></p>

        <p>The first two variables deal with pointing to the message broker/database used by all workers and are fairly self explanatory. The other env variables have to do with setting up an authentication system for the flower dashboard, which is not enabled in the development environment.</p>
    
        <pre>
            <code>
  # Celery Monitor Flower:       
  celery-flower-monitor:
    command: ["./run_celery_flower.sh"]
    env_file: 
      dev.env
            </code>
        </pre>
        
        <p>Flower uses Githubs OAuth system for authenticating users and that system is configured according to the (very limited) docs. Basically all the auth tokens and ids are defined by the env variables and the celery flower command in the <code>.sh</code> file is run with the <code>-auth_provider=flower.views.auth.GithubLoginHandler</code> and the <code>—auth=thegithubaccountemail@example.com</code> flags. If flower is run in the development environment no auth system is required (all <code>.sh</code> scripts contain conditional logic that checks for production status. See the script below).</p>
    
        <pre>
            <code>
#!/bin/sh
sleep 12

# Running the flower daemon based on if the environment is development or production:
if [ "$PRODUCTION" = True ]; then

    echo "Running Flower in a Production environment"
    # Running with the Github Auth system:
    celery flower --auth_provider=$FLOWER_AUTH_SCHEME --auth=$FLOWER_GIT_EMAIL
else

    echo "Running Flower in a Development environment"
    # Running without the auth system:
    celery flower
fi            </code>
        </pre>
    
        <h3>Message Broker and Backend</h3>
        <p>As we are currently not intending to scale the celery scheduled ingestion process we do not need a data persistent backend or the ability to handle a large amount of messages. As such we used redis as both our message broker and celery backend. Here our redis instance is configured in our docker-compose file:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
  # Redis Database for Celery:
  celery-redis:
    command: ["./run_redis.sh"]
    env_file: 
      dev.env
            </code>
        </pre>        
    </div>
    
</div>

<div class="documentation_section">
    <h1 id="databases">Databases on the backend</h1>
    <p>The main persistent database that services use is PostgreSQL. It is built using the official postgres docker image and is configured using the standard environment variables:</p>    
    <p><code>POSTGRES_USER</code></p>
    <p><code>POSTGRES_PASSWORD</code></p>
    <p><code>POSTGRES_DB</code></p>
    <p><code>POSTGRES_PORT</code></p>
    <p><code>POSTGRES_HOST</code></p>

    <pre>
      <code>
  # PostgreSQL Database for the rest api:
  rest-api-psql:
    volumes: 
      - rest-api-psql-volume:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    env_file: 
      dev.env
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In production it is connected to an external docker volume to maintain persistence. When logging and backup services are added to the project they will be described here.</p>
  
  </div>

<div class="documentation_section">
    <h1 id="nginx">Nginx as a reverse proxy</h1>
    <p>Nginx is used a the reverse-proxy server and gateway for external traffic entering the project. Currently it routes traffic to the django gunicorn server and the flower dashbaord. It is configured via the <code>default.conf</code> file below:</p>    

    <pre>
      <code>
upstream rest-api {
    server private-rest-api:80;
}
upstream flower {
    server celery-flower-monitor:5555;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
         proxy_pass http://rest-api;
         proxy_set_header Host $host:$server_port;
    }
}   

server {   
    listen 81;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://flower;
    }

}
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Based on the basic config file above it routes external traffic from ports 80 and 81 to the django gunicorn and flower servers respectively. As such those are the ports in the internal docker network that are exposed:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
  # The Nginx Server for Routing Traffic:
  nginx-reverse-proxy:
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "81:81"
      </code>
    </pre>

</div>

<div class="documentation_section">
    <h1 id="gunicorn">Running the django web server (Gunicorn)</h1>
    <p>The heart of the project, the django server is built using the docker-compose commands:</p>   

    <pre>
      <code>
  # Django Server:
  private-rest-api:
    command: ["./start_server.sh"]
    env_file:
      dev.env
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>The environment variables that are necessary for the django server to run are indicated in the django <code>settings.py</code> files. There are also different settings files depending of if the server is run in a production or development environment. The settings file that the project uses is determined by the <code>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</code> environment variable (<code>private_rest_api.dev_settings</code>in development for example.)</p>
    <p>Database migrations, static file collections and actually launching the Gunicorn server are done by the <code>start_server.sh</code> script that is executed on startup by docker-compose:</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
if [ "$PRODUCTION" = True ]; then

    printf "\nRunning the Django Web Server in the Production Environment:\n"
    echo "Performing Static File Collection"
    python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
else

    printf "\nRunning the Django Web Server in the Development Environment:"
fi

# Applying Database Migrations:
echo "Making Database Migrations"
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate 

# Starting the celery schedueler processes:
echo "Starting the gunicorn server"
gunicorn private_rest_api.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:80
      </code>
    </pre>
</div>
