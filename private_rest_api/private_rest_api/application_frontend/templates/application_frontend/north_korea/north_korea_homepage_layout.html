        <h1>The North Korea Dashboard</h1>
        <p>The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea more commonly known as North Korea has been a personal interest of mine for a long time. The autocratic nation-state formed in the aftermath of World War 2 is undeniably fascinating for a variety of reasons: Its fascinating history with the West, its (at the time of writing) current antagonism towards the ROK (South Korea), Japan and the US, the threats of nuclear proliferation, ICBM tests and cyber-attacks all make it easy to focus on the seemingly insane actions of the rogue nuclear state of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>That said it is important not to lose focus on the humanitarian aspect- millions of North Koreans live in a perpetual state of food insecurity, political repression and disenfranchisement. While the majority of my articles and sources about North Korea are about topics such as military capabilities, multilateral dialogue and foreign policy I think it is important as we dive into these issues not to forget that while the foreign policy of the North Korean government produces interesting and significant debates/issues for the international community, their domestic policy is one that has and continues to cause a great deal of unnecessary suffering for its citizens.</p>

        <h1>DPRK Reading Resources</h1>


        <p>There are many ways that you can go about collecting information and it is beyond the scope of this dashboard to explore all of them and balance their many pros and cons. What I can do is give a few tips that I think will help in ensuring that you research remains grounded and fact-based. I am by no means perfect but all of these are hard lessons that I had to learn by experience while stumbling my way through (as I arguably still am) the online media environment. These tips (in no particular order) are:</p>
        
        <h4 class="sub-heading">Read a broad swath of sources but BE HONEST about the biases and limitations of each source</h3>
        <p>My preferred style of reading and gathering information on a topic is to at first read a broad swath of sources earnestly in order to get a feel for the particular biases and points of emphasis for each source. After a while I’ve naturally gravitated to a few sources and authors that I trust, but due to the initial breadth of my research I am aware that I am getting a biased accounting of events. More importantly than knowing that a source is biased (you can make an argument that every source is biased in some way), I roughly know how biased a source is and as such which aspects of information it is likely to emphasize over others. There is nothing wrong with being biased in this sense, as long as you are aware of what the biases are and that they do not compromise the credibility of the research/reporting. </p>
        
        <h4 class="sub-heading">Read articles all the way through, resist the urge to skim. Avoid headlines at all costs.</h3>
        <p>This one is straightforward. Skim articles at your own risk. North Korean research and reporting, particularly reporting is incredibly prone to hyperbole and outright misleading headlines. The sad reality of a lot of reporting these days is that it is built for you to consume news as a “flash-in-the-pan” style that evokes all the necessary emotions to keep you coming back but does not really leave you more informed at the end of the day. Ignoring headlines and reading op-eds, articles or god forbid primary sources is less of a flash and more of a slow burn emotionally but undoubtedly will leave you orders of magnitude more informed than if you had just read the headline.</p>
        
        <h4 class="sub-heading">Familiarize yourself with reoccurring characters and terminology in the space.</h3>
        <p>This will happen naturally if you take reading seriously but can be sped up by conscious effort. Is a particular think tank’s research frequently cited across multiple news sources? Do you notice a specific author talking about an issue across various mediums? The more specific you get with a topic the fewer number of people are involved. There may be a global community talking about issues relating to North Korea but there are most certainly re-occurring characters and firms that you will get to know as you become familiar with the landscape. </p>

        <h4 class="sub-heading">At least try to realize when you are speculating. Work hard to only make claims that the hard evidence can support and give yourself plenty of caveats to keep yourself grounded. Don’t think in binary, think in probability. </h3>
        <p>In a subject that is as starved for primary sources as North Korea experts often have to make heavy assumptions or outright speculate when performing analysis of a situation or decision. This cannot be avoided given the secretive and sudo-autarkic nature of the DPRK. As such experts are careful to caveat their statements and highlight what assumptions are underpinning their analysis. You should do the same. People often say don’t speculate, I think that is a lost battle. Speculating, or extrapolating based on existing information, is something people (myself included) do almost automatically. Instead of aggressively trying to stop yourself from making assumptions or speculating on information just be honest about it. Speculate away but be distinctly aware that “I may think that x is going to happen because of article y, but that’s based on my speculation, article y never said that x will happen, I just think it will based on my interpretation of y”. Always caveat your beliefs and be aware of the limitations of the actual information that you posses. That way when your speculation is proven untrue you can just examine your assumptions and say “damn, I thought x was bound to happen because I assumed a, b and c but with this new article c is completely different than I thought, it wasn’t likely that x would have happened after all”. </p>
    
        <p>It might sound like I am grandstanding, talking about all the ways that everyone else incorrectly engages in issues but I am just as bias prone as the next person and have made ever error on this list many times over. Its a continual process, one that I hope to continue to get better at over time. After all, my research is just beginning. To that end I made a heatmap showing the number of sources I read each day related to the Korean peninsula. I made the heatmap in the style of (shamelessly ripped off) the github contributions heatmap. You can click on a day to see that actual sources that I read. See <a href="">here</a> for more information on the heatmap and the associated Zotero API.</p>
